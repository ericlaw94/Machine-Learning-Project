# Machine-Learning-Project 

**Introduction**
In this repository, you will find several Machine Learning projects that I've work during my free time.
My current objective is to get to a level where I can confidently and independently implement ML solutions for various problems.
Hope you like it and thanks for checking it out. 

**Project 1 Basketball Tournament:**  In this project, I’ll use various ML technique such as KNN, Decision Tree, 
Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regreession to predict the basketball teams which are most likely to make it to the semifinal round of the College Basketball Tournament known as the Final Four.

**Projecvt 2 Titanic Survival Rate:** The goal of this project is to apply Logistic Regression Technique to predict passenger survivability rate based on real dataset provided. 

Upcoming Project 

- Build an e-mail spam classifier.
- Perform sentiment analysis and analyze customer reviews for Amazon Alexa products.
- Logistic Regression -Predict the survival rates of the titanic based on the passenger features (Done)
- Predict customer behavior towards targeted marketing ads on Facebook.
- Predicting bank client’s eligibility to retire given their features such as age and 401K savings. 
- Predict cancer and Kyphosis diseases.
- Detect fraud in credit card transactio
